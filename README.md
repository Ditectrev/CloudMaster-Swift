CloudMaster Swift is a powerful iOS application designed to help you prepare for various cloud certification exams like AWS, Azure, GCP, Scrum, and more. This app is a testament to the capabilities of modern AI language models like ChatGPT and Claude.AI, as it was developed solely with their assistance, without any prior Swift experience.

## Personal Goal

My goal with this project was to create an mobile application from scratch in a for me unknown languange and unknown IDE. Relying solely on the guidance provided by large language models like ChatGPT and Claude.AI i was able to create this Swift application within Xcode. This endeavor aimed to showcase the potential of these AI models in assisting developers, even those without prior experience in a particular language or framework.
